## Objective 
The main objective behind this paper is to develop a robot to perform the act of surveillance in domestic areas. Robots can be manually controlled or can be automatic based on the requirement. The purpose of this robot is to roam around and provide audio and video information from the given environment and to send that obtained information to the user.

This robot also uses various sensors that collects data and sends it to the Arduino microcontroller which controls the robot behavior. Along with the obtained live streamed video output, user can also obtain the presence of metal bombs using metal detectors. GPS and Tracking locations can be identified.
Thus, the action of surveillance can be performed. Further advancement project can provide surveillance even in defense areas.
